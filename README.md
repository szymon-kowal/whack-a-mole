# Whack-a-mole

It is definitely site where maybe you can`t whack a mole, but you can click on green rectangle.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the user interface.
- TypeScript: For adding type safety to the JavaScript code.
- HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- Vite: For bundling and optimizing the application.
- TailwindCSS: For designing a responsive and modern UI with utility-first CSS.

## Running the Application Locally

Fork the repository, then clone it to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Testing

This project is tested with:

- **Vitest**: For running unit and integration tests.
- **@testing-library/react**: For testing React components in a realistic environment.


To run the tests, use the command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Learning Objectives

- **TailwindCSS**: How I can speed-up development of sites by using Tailwind.
- **Testing**: I couldn`t resolve how I can mock Math.random function, so I needed to input my random function as input prop to App component, then I could mock it in my test.
